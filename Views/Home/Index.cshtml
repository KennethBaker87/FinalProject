    <h1><strong>The Sega Saturn Library</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>A full database to help you organize, view and pick out which game sounds good for the day. Feel free to update the database. An empty case will automatically be generated 
        for the main image of a new game created and I will either leave it empty if it is a homebrew or a rom hack or find the correct case and size accordingly to keep things 
        clean. Plenty of update ideas for the future including back of the box text from each game, original trailers or gameplay footage if a trailer can't be found, a sort by 
        feature for each category and a few fun ideas like a randomizer to help select a game to play based on your search specifications. Click on games to get started or enjoy 
        the great Segata Sanshiro. If you wern't into the games, you can't deny this great advertising campaign.</strong>
